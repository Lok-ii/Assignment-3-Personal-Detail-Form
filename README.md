    In the first line We have <!DOCTYPE html>, which declares the document type.
    
    <html> tag, which defines the whole html document.
    
    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag)
    
    <title>Personal Details</title> element sets the title of the HTML document, which appears on the browser's title bar or tab.
    
    Inside the body tag, a form is created using these tags :-

          <p> paragraph tag is used to write the heading or title of the form.
          <label> is used again to give a label to this item of the form.
          The <select> tag is used to create a dropdown list in an HTML form, it contains one or more <option> elements, which represent the available choices in the dropdown.
          The <br> tag is a self-closing tag used to insert a line break (new line) within the content..
          The <label> element associates a label with an input element. 
          Two <input> element with type "text" are used for entering the first name and last name, and <label> is used to give them a label.
          Then again <br> is used for next line.
          An input tag is used with type as "radio", which lets only one option to be choosen. The "name" attribute groups them together, allowing only one option to be selected.
          An input element with type "email" is used for entering the email address.
          An input element with type "date" for entering the date of birth is used.
          A <textarea> element is used for entering some text which is a little longer. Here it is used for address.
          An input element with type "button" is used for creating a button of any kind, here I created a submit button for submitting the form data.
